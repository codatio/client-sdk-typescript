  description: `List companies

The *List companies* endpoint returns a list of [companies](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/schemas/Company) associated to your instances.

A [company](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/schemas/Company) represents a business sharing access to their data.
Each company can have multiple [connections](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/schemas/Connection) to different data sources, such as one connection to Xero for accounting data, two connections to Plaid for two bank accounts, and a connection to Zettle for POS data.

## Filter by tags

The *List companies* endpoint supports the filtering of companies using [tags](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/managing-companies#add-metadata-to-a-company). It supports the following operators with [Codat’s query language](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/querying):

- equals (\`=\`)
- not equals (\`!=\`)
- contains (\`~\`)

For example, you can use the querying to filter companies tagged with a specific foreign key, region, or owning team: 
- Foreign key: \`uid = {yourCustomerId}\`
- Region: \`region != uk\`
- Owning team and region: \`region = uk && owningTeam = invoice-finance\``,
