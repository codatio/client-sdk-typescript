/**
 * In Codat, a company represents a business sharing access to their data. Each company can have multiple [connections](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-expenses-v1-api#/schemas/Connection) to different data sources such as one connection to [Xero](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/xero/accounting-xero) for accounting data, two connections to [Plaid](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/banking/plaid/banking-plaid) for two bank accounts and a connection to [Zettle](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/commerce/zettle/commerce-zettle) for POS data.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Typically each company is one of your customers.
 *
 * When you create a company, you can specify a `name` and we will automatically generate a unique `id` for the company. You can also add a `description` to store any additional information about the company.
