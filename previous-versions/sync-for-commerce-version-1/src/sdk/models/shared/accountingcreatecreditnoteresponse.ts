     * ## Overview
     *
     * Think of a credit note as a voucher issued to a customer. It is a reduction that can be applied against one or multiple invoices. A credit note can either reduce the amount owed or cancel out an invoice entirely.
     *
     * In the Codat system a credit note is issued to a [customer's](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer) accounts receivable.
     *
     * It contains details of:
     * * The amount of credit remaining and its status.
     * * Payment allocations against the payments type, in this case an invoice.
     * * Which customers the credit notes have been issued to.
