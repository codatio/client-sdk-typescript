     *
     * ## Overview
     *
     * Accounts are the categories a business uses to record accounting transactions. From the Accounts endpoints, you can retrieve a list of all accounts for a specified company.
     *
     * The categories for an account include:
     *   * Asset
     *   * Expense
     *   * Income
     *   * Liability
     *   * Equity.
     *
     * The same account may have a different category based on the integration it is used in. For example, a current account (known as checking in the US) should be categorized as `Asset.Current` for Xero, and `Asset.Bank.Checking` for QuickBooks Online.
     *
     * At the same time, each integration may have its own requirements to the categories. For example, a Paypal account in Xero is of the `Asset.Bank` category and therefore requires additional properties to be provided.
     *
     * To determine the list of allowed categories for a specific integration, you can:
     * - Follow our [Create, update, delete data](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/push) guide and use the [Get create account model](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-create-chartOfAccounts-model).
     * - Refer to the integration's own documentation.
     *
     * > **Accounts with no category**
     * >
     * > If an account is pulled from the chart of accounts and its nominal code does not lie within the category layout for the company's accounts, then the **type** is `Unknown`. The **fullyQualifiedCategory** and **fullyQualifiedName** fields return `null`.
     * >
     * > This approach gives a true representation of the company's accounts whilst preventing distorting financials such as a company's profit and loss and balance sheet reports.
