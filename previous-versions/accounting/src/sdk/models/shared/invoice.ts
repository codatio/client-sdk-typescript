 * > We distinguish between invoices where the company *owes money* vs. *is owed money*. If the company issued an invoice, and is owed money (accounts receivable) we call this an Invoice.
 * >
 * > See [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) for the accounts payable equivalent of bills.

 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
 *
 * In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
 *
 * - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
 * - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
 * - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
 * - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
 * - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
 *
 * > **Invoice PDF downloads**
 * >
 * > You can <a className="external" href="https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-invoice-pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.
 * >
 * > The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.
 *
 * > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
 * >
 * > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

    /**
     * Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
     *
     * It is not possible to perform the currency conversion with two or more non-base currencies participating in the transaction. For example, if a company's base currency is USD, and it has a bill issued in EUR, then the bill payment must happen in USD or EUR.
     *
     * Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
     *
     * For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
     *
