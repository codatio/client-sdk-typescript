     * ## Overview
     *
     * Direct costs are the expenses associated with a business' operations. For example, purchases of raw materials and service fees are considered direct costs.
     *
     * Direct costs include:
     *   * Purchasing an item and paying it off at the point of the purchase
     *   * Receiving cash from a refunded item if the refund is made by the supplier
     *   * Withdrawing money from a bank account
     *   * Writing a cheque
     *
     * Direct costs is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).
