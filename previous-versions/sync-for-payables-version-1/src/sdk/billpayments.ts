   * Delete bill payment

   * The *Delete bill payment* endpoint allows you to delete a specified bill payment from an accounting software.
   *
   * [Bill payments](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/schemas/BillPayment) are an allocation of money within any Accounts Payable account.
   *
   * ### Process
   * 1. Pass the `{billPaymentId}` to the *Delete bill payment* endpoint and store the `pushOperationKey` returned.
   * 2. Check the status of the delete operation by checking the status of the push operation either via
   *    1. [Push operation webhook](https://docs.codat.io/introduction/webhooks/core-rules-types#push-operation-status-has-changed) (advised),
   *    2. [Push operation status endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/get-push-operation).
   *
   *    A `Success` status indicates that the bill payment object was deleted from the accounting software.
   * 3. (Optional) Check that the bill payment was deleted from the accounting software.
   *
   * ### Effect on related objects
   * Be aware that deleting a bill payment from an accounting software might cause related objects to be modified.
   *
   * ## Integration specifics
   * Integrations that support soft delete do not permanently delete the object in the accounting software.
   *
   * | Integration | Soft Delete | Details |
   * |-------------|-------------|---------|
   * | QuickBooks Online  | No  | -
   * | QuickBooks Desktop | No  | -
   * | Oracle NetSuite    | No  | See [here](/integrations/accounting/netsuite/accounting-netsuite-how-deleting-bill-payments-works) to learn more.
   * | Xero               | Yes | -
   * | Sage Intacct       | No  | Some bill payments in Sage Intacct can only be deleted, whilst others can only be voided. Codat have applied logic to handle this complexity.
   *
   * > **Supported integrations**
   * >
   * > This functionality is currently supported for our QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Oracle NetSuite, Xero and Sage Intacct integrations.
