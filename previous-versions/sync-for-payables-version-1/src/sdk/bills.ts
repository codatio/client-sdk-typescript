  /**
   * Delete bill
   *
   * @remarks
   * The *Delete bill* endpoint allows you to delete a specified bill from an accounting software.
   *
   * [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/schemas/Bill) are itemized records of goods received or services provided to the SMB.
   *
   * ### Process
   * 1. Pass the `{billId}` to the *Delete bill* endpoint and store the `pushOperationKey` returned.
   * 2. Check the status of the delete operation by checking the status of the push operation either via
   *     1. [Push operation webhook](https://docs.codat.io/introduction/webhooks/core-rules-types#push-operation-status-has-changed) (advised),
   *     2. [Push operation status endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/operations/get-push-operation).
   *
   *    A `Success` status indicates that the bill object was deleted from the accounting software.
   * 3. (Optional) Check that the bill was deleted from the accounting software.
   *
   * ### Effect on related objects
   *
   * Be aware that deleting a bill from an accounting software might cause related objects to be modified. For example, if you delete a paid bill in QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop, the bill is deleted but the bill payment against that bill is not. The bill payment is converted to a payment on account.
   *
   * ## Integration specifics
   * Integrations that support soft delete do not permanently delete the object in the accounting software.
   *
   * | Integration | Soft Delete | Details                                                                                                      |

   * | QuickBooks Desktop | No          | - |
   * | Oracle NetSuite   | No          | When deleting a bill that's already linked to a bill payment, you must delete the linked bill payment first. |                                                                                                      |
   * | Sage Intacct   | No          | When deleting a bill that's already linked to a bill payment, you must delete the linked bill payment first. |
   * | Xero   | No          | Draft bills will be deleted. Open bills will be voided instead of deleted since Xero only allows voiding a bill once it's been posted. When deleting a bill that's already linked to a bill payment, you must delete the linked bill payment first. |
