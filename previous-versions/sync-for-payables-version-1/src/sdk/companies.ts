   * List companies
   *
   * @remarks
   * The *List companies* endpoint returns a list of [companies](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/schemas/Company) associated to your instances.
   *
   * A [company](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/schemas/Company) represents a business sharing access to their data.
   * Each company can have multiple [connections](https://docs.codat.io/sync-for-payables-api#/schemas/Connection) to different data sources, such as one connection to Xero for accounting data, two connections to Plaid for two bank accounts, and a connection to Zettle for POS data.
   *
   * ## Filter by tags
   *
   * The *List companies* endpoint supports the filtering of companies using [tags](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/managing-companies#add-metadata-to-a-company). It supports the following operators with [Codat’s query language](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/querying):
   *
   * - equals (`=`)
   * - not equals (`!=`)
   * - contains (`~`)
   *
   * For example, you can use the querying to filter companies tagged with a specific foreign key, region, or owning team:
   * - Foreign key: `uid = {yourCustomerId}`
   * - Region: `region != uk`
   * - Owning team and region: `region = uk && owningTeam = invoice-finance`
