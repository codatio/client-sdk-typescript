 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
 *
 * In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
 *
 * - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
 * - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
 * - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
 * - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
 * - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
 *
 * > **Invoices or bills?**
 * >
 * > In Codat, invoices represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable invoices, see [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).
 *
 * > **Invoice PDF downloads**
 * >
 * > You can <a className="external" href="https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-invoice-pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.
 * >
 * > The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.
 *
 * > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
 * >
 * > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
 *
 * In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
 *
 * - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
 * - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
 * - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
 * - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
 * - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
 *
 * > **Invoices or bills?**
 * >
 * > In Codat, invoices represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable invoices, see [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).
 *
 * > **Invoice PDF downloads**
 * >
 * > You can <a className="external" href="https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-invoice-pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.
 * >
 * > The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.
 *
 * > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
 * >
 * > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

   *
   * ## Overview
   *
   * An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
   *
   * In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
   *
   * - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
   * - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
   * - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
   * - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
   * - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
   *
   * > **Invoices or bills?**
   * >
   * > In Codat, invoices represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable invoices, see [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).
   *
   * > **Invoice PDF downloads**
   * >
   * > You can <a className="external" href="https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-invoice-pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.
   * >
   * > The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.
   *
   * > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
   * >
   * > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.
