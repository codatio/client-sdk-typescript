 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Think of a credit note as a voucher issued to a customer. It is a reduction that can be applied against one or multiple invoices. A credit note can either reduce the amount owed or cancel out an invoice entirely.
 *
 * In the Codat system a credit note is issued to a [customer's](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer) accounts receivable.
 *
 * It contains details of:
 * * The amount of credit remaining and its status.
 * * Payment allocations against the payments type, in this case an invoice.
 * * Which customers the credit notes have been issued to.

   * @remarks
   *
   * Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
   *
   * Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
   *
   * For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
