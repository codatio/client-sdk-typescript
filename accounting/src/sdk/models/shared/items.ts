     *
     * Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
     *
     * Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
     *
     * For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
