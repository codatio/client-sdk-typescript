     * Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
     *
     * It is not possible to perform the currency conversion with two or more non-base currencies participating in the transaction. For example, if a company's base currency is USD, and it has a bill issued in EUR, then the bill payment must happen in USD or EUR.
     *
     * Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
     *
     * For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
