    description: `Create direct cost

The *Create direct cost* endpoint creates a new [direct cost](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/DirectCost) for a given company's connection.

[Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/DirectCost) are the expenses associated with a business' operations. For example, purchases of raw materials that are paid off at the point of the purchase and service fees are considered direct costs.

**Integration-specific behaviour**

Required data may vary by integration. To see what data to post, first call [Get create direct cost model](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-create-directCosts-model).`,
    args,
    tool: async (client, args, ctx) => {
      const [result, apiCall] = await loanWritebackDirectCostsCreate(
        client,
        args.request,
        { fetchOptions: { signal: ctx.signal } },
      ).$inspect();

      if (!result.ok) {
        return {
          content: [{ type: "text", text: result.error.message }],
          isError: true,
        };
      }

      const value = result.value;

      return formatResult(value, apiCall);
    },
  };
