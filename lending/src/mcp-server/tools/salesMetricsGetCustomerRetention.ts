  description: `Get customer retention metrics

The *Get customer retention metrics* endpoint returns customer retention insights for a specific company's commerce connection over one or more periods of time.

This detail helps you assess a merchant's health and advise them on performance improvement strategies. It also provides you with key insights you need to assess the credit risk of a company. 

#### Customer retention metrics

- __Existing customers__: the number of unique customers that have placed an order(s) in the specified period and any previous period. 
- __New customers__: the number of unique customers that have placed an order(s) in the specified period and none in any previous period.
- __Total customers__: the total number of existing and new customers within the specified period.
- __Retention rate__: the ratio of existing customers within the specified period compared to the total customers at the end of the previous period represented as a percentage.
- __Repeat rate__: the ratio of existing customers to total customers over the specified period represented as a percentage.

#### Response structure

The Customer retention report's dimensions and measures are:

| Index                       | Dimensions                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| \`index\` = 0                 | Period                     |
| \`index\` = 1                 | Customer retention metrics |

| Index                | Measures    |
|----------------------|------------|
| \`index\` = 0          | Count      |
| \`index\` = 1          | Percentage |

The report data then combines multiple reporting dimensions and measures and outputs the value of each combination.`,

      client,

        content: [{ type: "text", text: result.error.message }],
        isError: true,
      };
    }

    const value = result.value;

    return formatResult(value, apiCall);
  },
};
