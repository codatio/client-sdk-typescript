     * ## Overview
     *
     * A bill credit note is issued by a supplier for the purpose of recording credit. For example, if a supplier was unable to fulfil an order that was placed by a business, or delivered damaged goods, they would issue a bill credit note. A bill credit note reduces the amount a business owes to the supplier. It can be refunded to the business or used to pay off future bills.
     *
     * In the Codat API, a bill credit note is an accounts payable record issued by a [supplier](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Supplier).
     *
     * A bill credit note includes details of:
     * * The original and remaining credit.
     * * Any allocations of the credit against other records, such as [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).
     * * The supplier that issued the bill credit note.
