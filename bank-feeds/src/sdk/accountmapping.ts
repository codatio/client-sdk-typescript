  /**
   * Create bank feed account mapping
   *
   * @remarks
   * The *Create bank account mapping* endpoint creates a new mapping between a source bank account and a potential account in the accounting software (target account).
   *
   * A bank feed account mapping is a specified link between the source account (provided by the Codat user) and the target account (the end user's account in the underlying software).
   *
   * To find valid target account options, first call the [List bank feed account mappings](https://docs.codat.io//bank-feeds-api#/operations/get-bank-account-mapping) endpoint.

   * #### Account mapping variability
   *
   * The method of mapping the source account to the target account varies depending on the accounting software your company uses.
   *
   * #### Mapping options:
   *
   * 1. **API Mapping**: Integrate the mapping journey directly into your application for a seamless user experience.
   * 2. **Codat UI Mapping**: If you prefer a quicker setup, you can utilize Codat's provided user interface for mapping.
   * 3. **Accounting Platform Mapping**: For some accounting software, the mapping process must be conducted within the software itself.
   *
