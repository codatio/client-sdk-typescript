  /**
   * Create source account
   *
   * @remarks
   * The _Create Source Account_ endpoint allows you to create a representation of a bank account within Codat's domain. The company can then map the source account to an existing or new target account in their accounting software.
   *
   * #### Account mapping variability
   *
   * The method of mapping the source account to the target account varies depending on the accounting software your company uses.
   *
   * #### Mapping options:
   *
   * 1. **API Mapping**: Integrate the mapping journey directly into your application for a seamless user experience.
   * 2. **Codat UI Mapping**: If you prefer a quicker setup, you can utilize Codat's provided user interface for mapping.
   * 3. **Accounting Platform Mapping**: For some accounting software, the mapping process must be conducted within the software itself.
   *
   * ### Integration-specific behaviour
